# frontend-project

Hello from Codetta Stone and welcome to our frontend-project.

Our project is a quizz app which is designed to help School Of Code Bootcampers on their journey to greatness.

The Idea behind the quizz is for a bootcamper to find help in developing their knowledge of the fundamentals of coding. Whilst on the course and to identify any areas which they may need to work on.

The concept came with the realisation that the course is very fast paced, which could leave the cohort member feeling overwhelmed and confused. Also the quiz is designed for those who have limited time post bootcamp hours to study.

With this in mind Codetta Stone decided to add an extra layer of functionality to the quiz in the way of guided resources. This is to help the user to understand the questions and answers in more detail.

The app itself consists of a Navbar, which in itself comprises our team name, and links for Home, Learning Resources with a drop down menu and links to external resources, registration link, login and a search bar.

The app also contains a hidden side bar opperated from a quiz button under our team name on the navbar.
within the side bar are three quiz buttons of various degrees of dificulty. The user can select the quiz they wish to take and will be presented with a series of questions. The user can select the answer they think is correct and will be given a score at the end of the quiz.
