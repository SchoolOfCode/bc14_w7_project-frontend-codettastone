Hello from Codetta Stone and welcome to our frontend-project.

## <span style="color:orange">The Idea</span>

Our project is a quiz app which is designed to help School Of Code Bootcampers on their journey to greatness!

The Idea behind the quizz is for a bootcamper to find help in developing their knowledge of the fundamentals of coding. Whilst on the course and to identify any areas which they may need to work on.

## <span style="color:orange">How The App Started</span>

- <span style="color:blue">Too Fast</span>

Whilst doing our reasearch the realisation that the course is very fast paced, which could leave the cohort member feeling overwhelmed and confused. Also the quiz is designed for those who have limited time post bootcamp hours to study.

- <span style="color:blue">The Solution - A Quiz</span>

With this in mind Codetta Stone decided to create a quiz with an extra layer of functionality in the way of guided resources. This is to help the user to understand the questions and answers in more detail.

## <span style="color:orange">The App and How To Use</span>
The app itself consists of a Navbar, which in itself comprises our team name, and links for Home, Learning Resources with a drop down menu and links to external resources, registration link, login and a search bar.

The app also contains a hidden side bar opperated from a quiz button under our team name on the navbar.
within the side bar are three quiz buttons of various degrees of dificulty. The user can select the quiz they wish to take and will be presented with a series of questions. The user can select the answer they think is correct and will be given a score at the end of the quiz.
